Hi I'm Lisa Lin, and I program websites for fun. Currently, I am working on the [The Odin Project](http://theodinproject.com), which I find to be an invaluable free web development learning resource. If you want to see more of my work you can check out my [Projects](http://lisa-lin.github.io/projects/) page, or for more code see my [Github](https://github.com/lisa-lin).

### More Information

I have experience in Ruby, Ruby on Rails, Git, HTML & CSS, JavaScript & JQuery, SQL, and Bootstrap.
