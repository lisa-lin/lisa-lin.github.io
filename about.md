Hi! I'm Lisa Lin, a self-taught web developer living in Columbus, Ohio. After I completed my undergrad at Duke University, I worked at [Epic Systems](http://www.epic.com/) and now [McGraw-Hill Education](http://www.mheducation.com/) in the consulting and project management divisions. Working in software environments sparked my interest to learn more about programming, so I started [The Odin Project](http://theodinproject.com) and was hooked. Since then, I spend my free time reading about Computer Science topics, building web applications, and being dorky with my wonderful husband Jeffrey.

### More Information

I have experience in Ruby, Ruby on Rails, Git, HTML & CSS, JavaScript & JQuery, SQL, and Bootstrap.
