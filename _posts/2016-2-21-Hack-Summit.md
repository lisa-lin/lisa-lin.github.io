This week [hack.summit()]((https://hacksummit.org/)) is hosting a virtual event for developers, which will be the largest virtual programming conference and hackathon in history.
I just finished watching Orion Henry (Founder of Heroku) share his story and am now watching Dries Buytaert, the creator of Drupal.
Check out the schedule and register [here](https://hacksummit.org/)!
